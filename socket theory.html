WebSockets is a next-generation bidirectional communication technology for 
web applications which operates over a single socket and is exposed via a JavaScript 
interface in HTML 5 compliant browsers.


nce you get a Web Socket connection with the web server, you can send data from browser to server by calling a send() method, and receive data from server to browser by an onmessage event handler.

Following is the API which creates a new WebSocket object.

var Socket = new WebSocket(url, [protocal] );
